<!--

part1.html is a simple version of the game.
When the file is loaded a color is randomly selected from an array of colors 
and a loop begins which repeatedly asks the player what the color is. 
However, no feedback is given to the player depending on what he/she enters.
The loop simply finishes when the player enters the correct color.
